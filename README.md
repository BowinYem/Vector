# Vector
This is a basic implementation of the C++/STL Vector container. It is not as complex as other implementations, but has most of vector's
common features like: 

- Move/copy constructors
- Intialization from an initializer list
- Operators like the index operators and comparison operators for lexicographical comparisons
- Operations to resize the container and reserve more memory for it
